#2. Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, 
# between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printedin a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

#4. Write a Python program to find the volume of a sphere with diameter 12 cm.
